## What is $Mooney

The $MOONEY token launched on **Friday, December 17, 2021** on Juicebox. The funding period lasted for one lunar cycle and ended on **Sunday, January 16, 2022 at 3:18 PM EST**.

Mooney is moonDAO's governance token, and the owner can vote and participate in the organization's actions. When MoonDAO was founded, it declared that it was not responsible for the market price of the token. Since MoonDAO's treasury retains 50% of the tokens, the increase in token value will help MoonDAO to carry out space exploration and complete MoonDAO's original mission.

## **Distribution & tokenomics[](https://moondao.com/docs/token#distribution--tokenomics)**

1. Our token has a fixed supply. Now that our initial token raise is over, we will never increase the supply of the tokens.
2. Our token is used for governance decisions. We will have proportional governance up to a community decided limit. The limit is needed so that if one person buys more than 51% of the tokens they cannot centrally control the DAO’s decisions. To begin, we will use a 4% limit of the total coin supply, however anyone is welcome to purchase more than 4% if they would like to contribute more.
3. The funds raised from this token will pay the workers needed to complete the rest of the roadmap (NFT designers, website developers, solidity developers, marketing, legal consulting, etc.).
4. The token raise was conducted on Juicebox, and every contribution created governance tokens at a fixed rate. Contributors received 50% of those tokens in their wallets, and the remaining 50% stay with the DAO in order to fund the work required to make this DAO function. These tokens form part of the shared treasury that token holders can vote on with their tokens.

**There is no expectation of profit with this token. It is a governance token. You are not receiving fractionalized ownership of the DAOs assets in exchange for the token, check our FAQs for more information and disclaimers.**
