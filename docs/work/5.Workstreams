We've organized all the work at MoonDAO into separate workstreams (guilds or projects). Each workstream has a team of @Moon Settlers and is led by @Voyager. 
In order to get started, you can find the workstream you're most suited to help with and contact the @Voyager leading that workstream
Not every workstream will be ready to take on new people, but when they are ready they can ping you (and interview you). If the @Voyager decides to put you on their team, they will give you a @Moon Settlers role.
Alternatively, if that workstream has set up a bounty board, you can permissionlessly start doing any task off of the bounty board, and get paid for doing that bounty!
