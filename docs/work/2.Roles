We have a very flat hierarchy at MoonDAO, there are only three roles: @Astronauts @Voyager @Moon Settlers. 

@Moon Settlers are members of our community that have contributed positively during a pay cycle. They are anyone that have done a task from one of the Rocketeers, or have contributed a task that MoonDAO has found valuable (as decided by the Rocketeers and Astronauts). MoonSettlers come and go, and if they are no longer contributing after a pay cycle then their role is sun-setted to keep things fresh (they can always come back later with a new contribution).

@Voyager are members of our community that are voted in by moonsettlers to lead a specific workstream. Some workstreams may not need rocketeers, and others may need multiple rocketeers. These leaders are expected to be the point of contact and are responsible for driving a workstream to completion on schedule. Rocketeers also have the ability to add moonsettlers to their teams to help achieve their goals. Rocketeers are also sunsetted after the pay cycle, and are re-elected back into the community if needed, this keeps things fresh and requires a "vote of confidence" after work is finished.

@Astronauts Can "top down" declare workstreams as being needed and can appoint in Rocketeers to lead the workstreams. Ideally workstreams are emergent and rocketeers are placed bottom up, but in some cases some "top down" organization is needed and Astronauts can do this (these are powers to be used only in situations that need quick action).
