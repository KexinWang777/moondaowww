## What are projects?

Projects can be initiated by guilds or specific person. It is separated in order to move things forward more efficiently and can apply funds more clearly and apparently.

## Workflow

1. Projects will be proposed by a **@Moon Settlers @Voyager** or **@Astronauts** to the community 
2. A channel is created for the workflow to get started and come up with the with clear goals, timeline, leaders, and budget. Whoever has the idea can bring in anyone they want into that chat.
3. If a budget is needed a snapshot will be created. Budget is not made to "pay" the contributors, but simply to cover the expenses of the project. Payment for contributors will still be done in one big coordinape.
4. If a budget is needed, a multisig will be created for each project that includes 5 people on that project (including **@Astronauts**) with a 3/5 signer limit.
5. All expenses will be tracked and then reported up to the DAO to ensure that all payments are in the spirit of the project. Any abuse of MoonDAO funds will result in removal from the DAO.
