## Innovation

Space exploration should unify the world, not pit us against each other like the last space race. After all, aren't we all curious earthlings who want to explore the unknown? Now, Web 3.0 represents a technology that can unify Earth and decentralize space exploration. Place a MoonDAO colony on the moon. This is one small step for ordinary people, but one giant leap for mankind to explore space.

# Community

If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together. We believe that our community is our greatest asset. Astronauts and earth control, and all other roles are equally important in fulfilling our mission.

## **Fairness**

The core team does not reserve any tokens. We don't give "special terms" to any VCs, influencers, angel investors, friends or family of rich people, or anyone else. All people should be treated equally and share the right to space exploration fairly.
